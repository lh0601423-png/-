# TheMasterplan

This block is the project Context Router. Load guidance only when the task needs it.

- routine delivery and external-ownership decisions: `core/workflow.md`
- authorization / merge / release / destructive remote action: `core/policy.md`
- VCS release/tag: load the selected installed profile under `profiles/`
  (the adopted project contains only its selected profile)
- adoption/update maintenance: use the installed `.themasterplan/bin/themasterplan.py`
  commands; consult upstream adoption/update docs only for that maintenance task

Do not preload the whole rule stack.

Within the authorized scope, continue until the requested result exists, relevant
validation passes, failures caused by the change are fixed and revalidated, and
the final diff is reviewed — or until a genuine human decision boundary is reached.
